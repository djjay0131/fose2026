# Product Context: Research Goals and Community Impact

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-12

## Problem Statement

Software engineering research has experienced sustained growth in output and participation over the past decades. Despite this productivity, the field struggles with fragmented knowledge, weak linkages between claims and evidence, high costs of rediscovery and reinterpretation, and limited mechanisms for cumulative knowledge building.

**Core Tension:** High research productivity but limited cumulative knowledge progress.

## Solution Approach

This FOSE paper provides a community-informed diagnosis of structural barriers to knowledge accumulation and articulates principles for future research artifacts that support interpretability, inspectability, provenance, and long-lived knowledge substrates.

**Not a solution paper.** This is a diagnosis and principled call-to-action appropriate for the FOSE track.

## Target Audience

### Primary Audience
- Software engineering researchers (academic and industrial)
- FOSE track attendees and reviewers
- Community leaders interested in research infrastructure

### Secondary Audience
- Conference organizers and program committees
- Research funding agencies
- Tool builders and infrastructure developers

### Expected Reader Background
- Familiarity with SE research publication norms
- Experience with challenges of literature review and knowledge synthesis
- Interest in meta-research and future directions for the field

## User Experience Goals

### Reading Experience
- **Reflective**: Readers recognize their own experiences in the diagnosis
- **Agenda-setting**: Readers see clear direction for community action
- **Evidence-grounded**: Survey data legitimizes the structural claims
- **Actionable**: Principles provide concrete guidance without over-prescription

### Engagement Goals
- Stimulate discussion at FOSE session
- Inspire follow-on research on knowledge infrastructure
- Influence conference and publication practices
- Provide vocabulary for discussing accumulation challenges

## Key Research Questions

1. **Diagnosis**: What structural factors limit cumulative knowledge progress in SE research?
2. **Evidence**: How does the FOSE pre-survey reveal symptoms of these structural issues?
3. **Principles**: What properties should future research artifacts have to support accumulation?
4. **Implications**: How would these principles change research practice, publication, and infrastructure?

## Success Metrics

### Paper Quality Metrics
- Accepted to ICSE 2026 FOSE track
- Positive reviewer feedback on diagnosis and principles
- No major criticisms about over-prescription or tool evangelism
- Clear positioning as reflective, agenda-setting contribution

### Community Impact Metrics (Post-Publication)
- Citations by papers on research infrastructure and knowledge graphs
- Discussion in FOSE session and broader SE community
- Influence on future conference formats or artifact requirements
- Adoption of terminology (e.g., "knowledge accumulation", "structured research objects")

### Long-Term Impact Aspirations
- Shift in how SE community thinks about research artifacts
- Increased attention to knowledge infrastructure research
- Changes in publication norms emphasizing reusability and provenance
- FOSE as venue for experimenting with alternative artifact types

## Community Context

### What the FOSE Pre-Survey Reveals

**Demographics:**
- Highly experienced researchers (10+ years common)
- Highly productive (multiple recent submissions)
- Globally distributed participation

**Key Implication:**
Expertise and participation are NOT the bottleneck. The problem is structural, not individual.

**Survey Role in Paper:**
- High-level descriptive evidence
- Establishes legitimacy and urgency of argument
- Avoids heavy statistical analysis
- Used to justify "community-informed" framing

### FOSE Track Goals

FOSE papers should:
- Articulate visions for future SE research
- Identify emerging challenges and opportunities
- Propose research agendas
- Stimulate discussion and debate
- Be forward-looking and reflective

**This paper aligns by:**
- Diagnosing structural limits to current practices
- Proposing principles for future research artifacts
- Positioning knowledge infrastructure as critical future direction
- Avoiding prescriptive solution proposals

## Value Proposition

### For SE Researchers
- Vocabulary for articulating frustrations with current practices
- Principled framework for thinking about artifact design
- Evidence that accumulation challenges are systemic, not individual failures

### For Conference Organizers
- Motivation for reconsidering publication and artifact norms
- Framework for evaluating alternative submission formats
- Case for FOSE as experimentation venue

### For Infrastructure Developers
- Principles guiding tool and platform development
- Community validation of need for better knowledge substrates
- Alignment between research needs and infrastructure capabilities

### For Funding Agencies
- Case for investment in research infrastructure
- Demonstration that SE community recognizes accumulation challenges
- Principles for evaluating infrastructure proposals

## Framing Constraints

### What This Paper IS
- Community-informed diagnosis
- Principled position paper
- Evidence-backed perspective
- Agenda-setting for future research
- FOSE-appropriate reflective piece

### What This Paper IS NOT
- A tooling paper
- A single-solution proposal
- Technology-prescriptive
- Empirically overclaiming from survey data
- Self-promotional

### Tone Guidelines
- Reflective, not prescriptive
- Evidence-grounded, not anecdotal
- Principled, not evangelistic
- Forward-looking, not critical for sake of criticism
- Community-focused, not individual-focused

## Related Work Context

### Themes to Position Against
- Knowledge graphs in science (ORKG, AI-KG, etc.)
- Meta-research and reproducibility
- Research infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure
- Cumulative science and replication
- Science of science and scientometrics

### Positioning Strategy
- Acknowledge existing efforts
- Emphasize structural diagnosis over tool comparison
- Use related work to establish broader context
- Avoid appearing naive about prior work
- Position principles as synthesis, not novelty

## Risk Mitigation

### Reviewer Concerns to Address
- **"Too vague"**: Use survey data and concrete examples
- **"Just another tool paper"**: Explicitly frame as diagnosis + principles
- **"Overclaiming from survey"**: Use survey for legitimacy, not heavy inference
- **"Not actionable"**: Provide principles and implications sections
- **"Missing related work"**: Include thorough background section

### Rhetorical Balance
- Diagnosis must be compelling but not purely negative
- Principles must be concrete but not over-prescriptive
- Survey use must be legitimate but not overclaimed
- Related work must be acknowledged but not exhaustive

---

**Remember:** This paper succeeds if it helps the SE community recognize structural accumulation challenges and provides a principled path forward, NOT if it promotes specific tools or solutions.
