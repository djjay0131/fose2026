# Archive Directory

## Purpose

This directory stores archived content from the memory-bank that is no longer actively needed but should be preserved for historical reference.

## Archive Structure

```
archive/
├── decisions/          # Archived decision logs from activeContext.md
├── drafts/            # Superseded section drafts
└── data-analysis/     # Survey analysis working notes
```

## When to Archive

- **Decisions:** When a phase completes and decisions are no longer actively referenced
- **Drafts:** When major section revisions supersede earlier versions
- **Data Analysis:** After Section 3 (Survey) is complete and finalized

## Archive Naming Convention

All archived files should be prefixed with the date of archival in `YYYY-MM-DD` format:

- `2026-01-15_decisions-phase1.md`
- `2026-01-20_survey-draft-v1.tex`
- `2026-01-18_survey-demographics-analysis.md`

## Cross-Referencing

When archiving content:
1. Move file to appropriate archive subdirectory
2. Add date prefix to filename
3. Update any cross-references in active memory-bank files
4. Document archival in `progress.md`

## Retrieval

Archived content remains accessible for reference. To retrieve:
1. Navigate to appropriate archive subdirectory
2. Files are sorted chronologically by date prefix
3. Review archived content as needed for historical context

**Note:** Archive is for preservation, not deletion. Important historical decisions and drafts should be archived, not removed from the repository.
