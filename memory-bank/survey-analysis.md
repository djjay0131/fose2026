| 0 | 8 | 2.9% |
| 1-3 | 54 | 19.3% |

### Primary Roles

Key roles represented in the survey (multiple selections allowed):
- Tenured university faculty member: ~35-40%
- Untenured university faculty member: ~15-20%
- Industrial researcher: ~10-15%
- Graduate student: ~15-20%
- Postdoctoral researcher: ~5-10%
- Practitioner: ~5-10%

## Core Argument for Section 3

### The Evidence

The FOSE pre-survey respondents demonstrate:

1. **High Experience**: 57.1% have 11+ years in SE research
2. **High Productivity**: 44.3% authored 11+ papers in 3 years
3. **Global Distribution**: 6 regions, 49.6% Europe, 25% North America

### The Implication

> Since the community is highly experienced, productive, and globally distributed, **expertise and participation are NOT the bottleneck** for knowledge accumulation.

### The Conclusion

> Therefore, challenges in cumulative knowledge building must be **STRUCTURAL** rather than due to lack of individual capacity or community engagement.

## Key Quotes for Section 3

### On What Works Well
- "Mostly open community. Vibrant events. Lots of opportunities to collaborate."
- "In-Person conferences are still a delight for those who can attend"

### On What Doesn't Work Well
- "Reviewing process: - quality of reviews is not always good - too many papers get submitted (and resubmitted)"
- "Fraud cases are not dealt with by bodies like IEEE"
- "We're not inclusive or sustainable enough insofar as the remote participation is lousy"
- "Adopting new technologies. Let's say NLP community already adopted LLM based annotation... yet in SE papers 30% of the justification goes to why this technology works well"

### On Desired Changes
- "I'd do away with all of our program committees and just do journal first for everything"
- "Be open to adopting new technologies and not treat everything with 'disdain' attitude"

### On Stress and Concerns
- "Too many papers to reviews. Difficulty finding good reviewers."
- "Not being open to new ideas until it's three years old"
- "Low quality reviews is something that I feel guilty about towards my current (and likely future) mentees"

## Usage in Section 3

### Structure for Section 3 (Survey Synthesis)

1. **Introduction**
   - Frame the survey purpose: understand community perspectives
   - Note: 280 completed responses from ICSE 2026 FOSE pre-survey

2. **Demographics Present the Community Profile**
   - **Table or Figure**: Demographics summary showing experience, productivity, geography
   - **Key Point**: This is an experienced, active, globally distributed community

3. **Establish the Core Implication**
   - Given this profile, lack of progress cannot be attributed to:
     - Lack of expertise (57% have 11+ years)
     - Lack of participation (44% authored 11+ papers in 3 years)
     - Geographic concentration (6 regions, truly global)
   - Therefore: **Challenges must be structural**

4. **Transition to Section 4**
   - Survey reveals community recognizes systemic issues
   - Selected responses hint at structural barriers
   - Section 4 will diagnose these structural breakdowns

### Writing Tone

- **Descriptive, not prescriptive**
- **High-level, not statistical**
- **Legitimizing, not overclaiming**
- **Transitional**: sets up structural diagnosis in Section 4

### What to Avoid

- ❌ Heavy statistical analysis or significance testing
- ❌ Overclaiming about what survey "proves"
- ❌ Presenting survey as comprehensive empirical study
- ❌ Implying causation from correlations

### What to Emphasize

- ✓ Survey establishes legitimacy for structural argument
- ✓ Community profile demonstrates capacity exists
- ✓ Therefore problem is not individual, but systemic
- ✓ Transition: "What then are these structural barriers?"

## Next Steps

1. Create `sections/` directory
2. Draft `sections/03_survey.tex` using this analysis
3. Consider creating a demographics table or figure
4. Validate survey claims against this analysis document

**Remember:** Survey data is for establishing **legitimacy and context**, NOT for heavy empirical claims. Use it to show the community is capable, therefore the problem is structural.
