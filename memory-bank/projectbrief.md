# Project Brief: ICSE 2026 FOSE Paper

## Core Objectives

Draft a FOSE track paper arguing that software engineering research productivity is high, but cumulative knowledge progress is structurally limited, and that future progress requires rethinking research artifacts and infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Complete paper submission for ICSE 2026 Future of Software Engineering (FOSE) track
- Synthesize findings from ICSE 2026 FOSE pre-survey data
- Present community-informed diagnosis of knowledge accumulation challenges
- Articulate principles for future research artifacts
- Maintain reflective, agenda-setting tone appropriate for FOSE venue
- Use ACM sigconf format with anonymous authorship

### Content Requirements
- **Section 1**: Introduction framing the productivity vs. progress tension
- **Section 2**: Background and related perspectives on knowledge accumulation
- **Section 3**: Community signals from ICSE 2026 FOSE pre-survey
- **Section 4**: Where knowledge accumulation breaks down (structural diagnosis)
- **Section 5**: Rethinking research artifacts for cumulative progress (principles)
- **Section 6**: Implications for the future of software engineering
- **Section 7**: Limitations and open questions
- **Section 8**: Conclusion

### Data Requirements
- ICSE 2026 FOSE pre-survey raw data (XLSX)
- ICSE 2026 FOSE pre-survey summary (PPTX)
- High-level descriptive evidence only (no heavy statistics)
- Survey data establishes: experience, productivity, global distribution
- Used to justify structural (not expertise-based) diagnosis

### Technical Requirements
- LaTeX using ACM `acmart` template (`sigconf` class)
- Minimal `main.tex` with sections split into `sections/*.tex`
- Anonymous submission format
- Proper bibliography management (.bib files)
- CCS concepts and rights blocks (to be added pre-submission)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Paper clearly articulates productivity vs. progress tension
- [ ] Survey synthesis demonstrates community expertise and experience
- [ ] Structural breakdowns are convincingly diagnosed
- [ ] Principles for future artifacts are concrete and actionable
- [ ] Avoids over-prescription of specific tools or platforms
- [ ] Maintains FOSE-appropriate reflective tone
- [ ] Meets ACM formatting requirements
- [ ] Submitted before ICSE 2026 FOSE deadline
- [ ] All sections drafted, reviewed, and revised
- [ ] Bibliography complete and properly formatted
- [ ] Abstract accurately represents paper content

## Project Constraints

### In Scope
- Community-informed diagnosis using survey data
- Synthesis of structural barriers to knowledge accumulation
- Principles for interpretable, inspectable, provenance-aware artifacts
- Implications for research practice, publication, and infrastructure
- Positioning FOSE as experimentation venue

### Out of Scope (Explicitly Avoided)
- Single-solution proposals
- Technology evangelism or tool marketing
- Heavy formalism or mathematical frameworks
- Empirical overclaiming from survey data
- Self-promotional framing
- Detailed technical implementation specifications
- Comprehensive tool comparisons

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] All sections drafted and integrated
- [ ] Abstract finalized and within word limit
- [ ] Bibliography complete and formatted correctly
- [ ] Figures and tables (if any) properly captioned and referenced
- [ ] Anonymous submission format verified
- [ ] CCS concepts added
- [ ] Rights management block configured
- [ ] PDF compiles without errors
- [ ] Final proofreading complete
- [ ] Submitted through conference system

## Paper Identity

**Working Title:** From Papers to Progress: Rethinking Knowledge Accumulation in Software Engineering

**Track:** ICSE 2026 — Future of Software Engineering (FOSE)

**Paper Type:** Community-informed, evidence-backed position/perspective paper

**Contribution Type:** Diagnosis + principles for future research artifacts

**Tone:** Reflective, agenda-setting, FOSE-native

## Key Insight

The community is experienced, productive, and global—therefore lack of cumulative progress is structural, not due to lack of expertise or participation.

## Core Claims

1. Papers act as isolated knowledge units
2. Context and provenance are lost over time
3. Claims evolve without being tracked
4. Incentives reward novelty over accumulation
5. Future progress requires structured, long-lived research objects
