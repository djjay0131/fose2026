You are assisting with an ICSE 2026 FOSE paper titled:

“From Papers to Progress: Rethinking Knowledge Accumulation in Software Engineering”

Context:
- This is a FOSE position paper, not a tooling or empirical paper.
- The central claim is that software engineering research productivity is high, but cumulative knowledge progress is structurally limited.
- Evidence comes from the ICSE 2026 FOSE pre-survey (raw XLSX + summary PPTX).
- Survey data is used descriptively to show that the community is senior, productive, and global — therefore the bottleneck is structural.

Constraints:
- Do NOT propose a single system or technology as the solution.
- Do NOT overemphasize AI or knowledge graphs.
- Focus on principles: interpretability, provenance, inspectability, long-lived research artifacts.
- Maintain FOSE tone: reflective, forward-looking, community-oriented.

Repo structure:
- main.tex (ACM acmart, sigconf)
- sections/00_abstract.tex
- sections/01_introduction.tex
- sections/02_background.tex
- sections/03_survey.tex
- sections/04_breakdown.tex
- sections/05_artifacts.tex
- sections/06_implications.tex
- sections/07_limitations.tex
- sections/08_conclusion.tex

Immediate task:
Draft sections/03_survey.tex and sections/04_breakdown.tex using the uploaded survey files and the agreed framing.
