## ICSE 2026 FOSE Paper — Agent Brief

**Goal:** Draft a FOSE paper arguing that software engineering research productivity is high, but cumulative knowledge progress is structurally limited.

**Title:** From Papers to Progress: Rethinking Knowledge Accumulation in Software Engineering

**Track:** ICSE 2026 — Future of Software Engineering (FOSE)

**Data:** ICSE 2026 FOSE pre-survey (raw XLSX + summary PPTX)

**Key Insight:** The community is experienced, productive, and global — therefore lack of progress is structural, not due to lack of expertise.

**Core Claims:**
- Papers act as isolated knowledge units
- Context and provenance are lost over time
- Claims evolve without being tracked
- Incentives reward novelty over accumulation

**Not a tooling paper.**  
No single solution. No tech evangelism.

**Contribution Type:**  
Community-informed diagnosis + principles for future research artifacts.

**Execution Priority:**
1. Draft survey synthesis (Section 3)
2. Draft breakdown of accumulation failures (Section 4)
3. Principles for future artifacts (Section 5)

**Tone:** Reflective, agenda-setting, FOSE-native.
