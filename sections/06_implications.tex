\section{From Principles to Practice: Implications for the Future of Software Engineering}
\label{sec:implications}

These four principles provide a framework for evaluating incremental steps: does a proposed tool or practice make artifacts more structured, inspectable, reusable, or better governed? The principles are technology-agnostic. Knowledge graphs, computational notebooks, and repositories are possible instantiations, but the principles describe \textit{properties}, leaving room for diverse implementations. The challenge is designing systems and reforming incentives so cumulative knowledge building becomes both possible and rewarded.

\subsection{Research Practice and Publication}

Research practice would shift toward documenting process alongside outcomes: recording methodological decisions and their rationales using computational notebooks, version control, and workflow platforms. Researchers would supplement narrative papers with structured representations (semantic annotations or knowledge graph entries) making contributions directly accessible for synthesis. Designing for reuse would become standard: datasets documented with schemas, code modular and documented, protocols reproducible.

Publication and review would need to value consolidation alongside novelty. Papers that resolve contradictions, curate benchmarks, or provide infrastructure deserve recognition. These replications are critical to avoid contributing to the ``vast graveyard of undead theories'' in software research~\cite{ferguson2012vast}. Conferences should treat structured artifacts as first-class contributions, not optional supplements~\cite{nakagawa2024artifacts}. As one participant noted, replication studies are considered ``\textit{thankless volunteer work}'' and ``\textit{it is not sustainable for people to be doing these things well and frequently without proper incentives}'' (196051220). Replication efforts in other domains found only about one-third of published experiments in psychology (39/100)~\cite{open2015estimating} and economics (22/67)~\cite{chang2015economics} could reproduce statistically significant results. If artifacts evolve post-publication, papers become snapshots while living artifacts accumulate evidence, requiring new norms for citing evolving work.

\subsection{Community Infrastructure}

The community needs platforms for storing, querying, and updating structured artifacts (knowledge graphs, benchmark repositories, collaborative platforms) maintained through community governance~\cite{atkins2003,keivanloo2022kgdev}. One survey participant proposed ``\textit{a shared repository for research ideas, datasets, and research materials that lead to better distribution, collaboration, and replication}'' (196181126). Shared standards (ontologies, schemas, reporting protocols) enable reuse across studies~\cite{wohlin2012}. Infrastructure contributions and replications need recognition through alternative metrics or contribution-tracking platforms~\cite{allen2019}. Governance structures manage stewardship: maintaining repositories, resolving disputes, addressing ethical concerns. Without such infrastructure, the principles stay aspirational.

\subsection{FOSE as a Venue for Experimentation}

The Future of Software Engineering track could support experimentation with alternative artifact types: submissions experimenting with structured artifacts or living documents, judged on potential to demonstrate new knowledge-organizing approaches rather than solely novelty.

Consider a study finding automated code review reduces defects by 15\%. Under current norms, this paper gets cited and superseded as its dataset ages. Under our principles, the group registers structured claims in a knowledge graph, links them to versioned data with provenance, and designs for reuse. When contradictions emerge, structured representations enable diagnosing whether differences stem from datasets or methods, turning disputes into refinement. FOSE could welcome such experiments, building evidence for broader adoption.
