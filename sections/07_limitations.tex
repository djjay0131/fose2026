\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

This paper diagnoses structural barriers and proposes principles, but does not provide complete solutions.

\textbf{Survey limitations.} Our analysis draws on 280 FOSE pre-survey responses, a self-selected fraction of the global community. The data are descriptive: they establish that the community is experienced and productive, supporting our argument that barriers are structural, but they do not prove specific breakdowns. The survey reflects perspectives at one moment, and our principles may not generalize to other domains.

\textbf{Feasibility challenges.} Producing structured, provenance-aware artifacts takes effort that researchers may lack without support. The needed infrastructure (shared repositories, standards, governance) does not yet exist in many areas~\cite{herman2020}. Adoption depends on changing incentives at multiple levels, which is difficult and slow.

\textbf{Ethical concerns.} Structured knowledge infrastructures raise questions about ownership, bias, access, and privacy. These are not purely technical issues; they require community deliberation and ongoing stewardship.
