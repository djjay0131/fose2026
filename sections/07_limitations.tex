\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

This paper diagnoses structural barriers and proposes principles for future research artifacts, but does not provide complete solutions. We acknowledge several limitations.

\textbf{Survey limitations.} Our analysis draws on 280 FOSE pre-survey responses, a self-selected fraction of the global community. The data are descriptive---they establish that the community is experienced and productive, supporting our argument that barriers are structural, but do not prove specific breakdowns. The survey reflects perspectives at one moment, and our proposed principles may not directly generalize to other domains.

\textbf{Feasibility challenges.} Realizing these principles faces practical barriers. Producing structured, provenance-aware artifacts requires effort researchers may lack without support. The needed infrastructure---shared repositories, standards, governance---does not yet exist in many areas~\cite{herman2020}. Adoption depends on changing incentives at multiple levels, which is difficult and slow.

\textbf{Ethical concerns.} Structured knowledge infrastructures raise questions about ownership, bias, access, and privacy. These are not purely technical issues---they require community deliberation, ethical oversight, and ongoing stewardship.
