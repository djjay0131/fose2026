\section{Community Signals from the ICSE 2026 FOSE Pre-Survey}
\label{sec:survey}

To ground our diagnosis in community perspectives, we draw on the ICSE 2026 Future of Software Engineering pre-survey (n=280)~\cite{storey_2025_18217799}. The respondents represent a mature, productive, and globally distributed research community: 57\% have 10+ years of experience, 44\% authored 11+ papers in the past three years, and participation spans six geographic regions (Europe 50\%, North America 25\%, Asia 15\%, others 10\%).

This profile is critical to our argument. If knowledge accumulation remains limited despite significant expertise, productivity, and global participation, then the barriers must be \textit{structural} rather than individual. The community is not lacking effort or output capacity---respondents themselves recognize systemic challenges in knowledge synthesis, with concerns about fragmentation across resubmissions, difficulties building on prior work, and systems that reward novelty over consolidation. These observations motivate the structural diagnosis that follows.
