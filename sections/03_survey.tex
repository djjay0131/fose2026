\section{Community Signals from the ICSE 2026 FOSE Pre-Survey}
\label{sec:survey}

We ground our diagnosis in the ICSE 2026 Future of Software Engineering pre-survey (n=280)~\cite{storey_2025_18217799}. Two researchers performed a lightweight qualitative analysis, examining comments for insights about knowledge-building in software engineering. The respondents span six geographic regions (Europe 50\%, North America 25\%, Asia 15\%, others 10\%) and represent a mature, productive community. This profile matters for our argument: if knowledge accumulation remains limited despite all this expertise and output, the barriers are \textit{structural}, not individual. The community is not lacking effort. Respondents themselves recognize systemic challenges, noting fragmentation across resubmissions, difficulties building on prior work, and incentives that reward novelty over consolidation. These observations motivate our diagnosis.
